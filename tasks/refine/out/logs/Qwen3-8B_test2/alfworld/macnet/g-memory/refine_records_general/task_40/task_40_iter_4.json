        "reasoning": "The Agent's initial plan to 'examine the pencil with the desklamp' was based on an incorrect assumption that 'look at' or 'examine' commands can be used directly with a light source. The Agent failed to recognize that the correct action for examining an object with a light source is to use the 'use' command with the light source, not the object itself.",
        "guidance": "When the goal involves examining an object with a light source, first ensure the light source is on, then use the 'use' command with the light source to illuminate the object. This avoids unnecessary trial-and-error with invalid commands and optimizes decision-making within step limits."
