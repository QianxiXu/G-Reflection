    "reasoning": "The Agent's initial plan assumed the presence of a bowl in the environment, but it failed to account for the possibility that the bowl might not be in the expected locations (e.g., cabinets). This led to an inefficient search strategy that wasted steps and ultimately failed to locate the bowl.",
    "guidance": "When planning a task, prioritize checking high-probability locations first (e.g., sinkbasin, countertop) for items that are commonly found there, and avoid assuming the presence of an item in locations where it is less likely to be found. This reduces unnecessary steps and increases the efficiency of the search process."

    "step_id": 3,
    "reasoning": "The Agent failed to check the sinkbasin or other likely locations for a bowl, such as the countertop or drawer, which are more probable places to find a bowl than checking the next cabinet. This inefficient search strategy led to a delay and ultimately the failure to complete the task.",
    "guidance": "When searching for an object like a bowl, prioritize locations that are more likely to contain it, such as the sinkbasin, countertop, or drawer, before moving to cabinets. This heuristic ensures efficient decision-making and reduces unnecessary steps in task completion."

    "reasoning": "The Agent failed to check the contents of cabinet 2 after opening it, leading to an inefficient search for the bowl. The Agent should have checked the contents immediately after opening the cabinet instead of proceeding to check subsequent cabinets without verifying the current one.",
    "guidance": "After opening a container, the Agent should immediately check its contents to confirm the presence of the target item. This avoids unnecessary steps and ensures efficient task completion by focusing on relevant information at each step."

    "step_id": 5,
    "reasoning": "The Agent failed to consider the possibility that the bowl might not be in any of the cabinets and instead continued searching sequentially without checking other potential locations, such as the kitchen counter or table. This inefficient approach led to an unnecessary waste of steps.",
    "guidance": "When searching for an object, the Agent should first check all likely locations (e.g., countertops, tables, drawers) before systematically checking cabinets. This heuristic prioritizes efficiency by reducing the number of steps required to locate an object."

    "reasoning": "The Agent failed to check all possible locations for the bowl efficiently. After checking cabinets 1-3 and finding no bowl, the Agent continued to check cabinet 4 without considering other more likely locations such as the countertop, drawer, or sinkbasin, which are also common places for bowls.",
    "guidance": "When searching for an object, prioritize locations based on their likelihood of containing the object. For example, check common locations like countertop, drawer, and sinkbasin before proceeding to less likely ones like cabinets. This reduces unnecessary steps and increases task completion efficiency."

    "window_start": 4,
    "step_id": 6,
    "reasoning": "The Agent failed to check the contents of cabinet 3 before moving to cabinet 4, leading to inefficient exploration and wasted steps. The Agent should have inspected the contents of each cabinet before proceeding to the next.",
    "guidance": "Always inspect the contents of an object before moving to the next one. This ensures efficient exploration and avoids unnecessary steps by confirming the presence or absence of the target item early in the process."

    "reasoning": "The Agent failed to consider the possibility of finding the bowl in the first cabinet it checked (cabinet 3) and instead proceeded to check subsequent cabinets without verifying the contents of the initial ones. This inefficient search strategy led to unnecessary steps and ultimately the failure to locate the bowl.",
    "guidance": "When searching for an object, the Agent should first verify the contents of the first potential location before proceeding to check other locations. This heuristic ensures efficient use of steps by prioritizing immediate checks over sequential exploration, reducing the risk of exceeding the step limit."

    "window_start": 7,

    "reasoning": "The Agent failed to consider the possibility of the bowl being in a more accessible location, such as the countertop, instead of continuing to check cabinets. This inefficient search strategy led to unnecessary steps and ultimately the failure to locate the bowl.",
    "guidance": "When searching for an object, prioritize locations that are more likely to contain the object based on common household arrangements (e.g., countertops for bowls). Avoid exhaustive checks of all cabinets unless explicitly instructed, to optimize decision logic and conserve steps."
  },

    "window_start": 8,
    "step_id": 8,
    "reasoning": "The Agent failed to consider the possibility of the bowl being in other locations, such as the kitchen or dining area, and instead focused only on cabinets. This limited the search space and led to an inefficient search strategy.",
    "guidance": "When searching for an object, the Agent should prioritize locations that are more likely to contain the object based on common household organization, such as countertops, tables, or kitchen areas, rather than focusing solely on cabinets. This heuristic ensures a more efficient search and reduces unnecessary steps."

    "window_start": 9,
    "step_id": 9,
    "reasoning": "The Agent failed to consider the possibility of checking the correct location for the bowl earlier. Instead of immediately checking cabinet 6, the Agent should have systematically checked all possible locations for the bowl, including the kitchen area or other storage units, which would have led to a faster discovery.",
    "guidance": "When searching for an object, prioritize checking likely locations (e.g., kitchen counters, cabinets, or storage units) in a systematic order, starting from the most probable ones. This reduces unnecessary steps and ensures efficient task completion."
  },
  {
    "window_start": 10,
    "step_id": 10,
    "reasoning": "The Agent correctly identified that the cabinet 6 was closed and needed to be opened. However, the Agent failed to check the contents of the cabinet thoroughly before moving on to other locations, which led to unnecessary steps and wasted time.",
    "guidance": "When encountering an object that is closed (e.g., a cabinet), always inspect its contents immediately after opening it to determine if the target item is present. This avoids unnecessary exploration of other locations and optimizes decision-making within step limits."

    "window_start": 11,
    "step_id": 11,
    "reasoning": "The Agent failed to recognize that the bowl was already present on countertop 3 in Step 13, but continued searching unnecessarily. This inefficient search wasted steps and delayed the task completion.",
    "guidance": "When searching for an object, the Agent should immediately check all previously visited locations before moving to new ones. This avoids redundant searches and optimizes step usage by prioritizing locations where the object is more likely to be found."

  {
    "window_start": 12,
    "step_id": 16,
    "reasoning": "The Agent failed to verify if the chosen cabinet (cabinet 1) is suitable for storing a bowl. The Agent assumed the cabinet was appropriate without checking its contents or capacity, leading to an inefficient decision that could have been avoided with a more systematic approach.",
    "guidance": "Before placing an object in a container, always check the container's contents and capacity to ensure it is a suitable location. This ensures efficient use of steps and avoids unnecessary actions."
