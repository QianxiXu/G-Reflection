    "reasoning": "The earliest root cause is the absence of any action steps, indicating the Agent failed to initiate any task planning or execution. Without any action, the task cannot progress, leading to failure.",
    "guidance": "Always begin with a valid action step, such as 'take' or 'go to', to initiate task execution. Prioritize actions that directly contribute to the task goal to optimize step usage and ensure progress."

    "reasoning": "The Agent's initial plan assumed the presence of a bowl in the environment, but it failed to account for the possibility that the bowl might not be in the expected locations (e.g., cabinets). This led to an inefficient search strategy that wasted steps and ultimately failed to locate the bowl.",
    "guidance": "When planning a task, prioritize checking high-probability locations first (e.g., sinkbasin, countertop) for items that are commonly found there, and avoid assuming the presence of an item in locations where it is less likely to be found. This reduces unnecessary steps and increases the efficiency of the search process."

    "reasoning": "The Agent failed to check the contents of cabinet 2 after opening it, leading to an inefficient search for the bowl. The Agent should have checked the contents immediately after opening the cabinet instead of proceeding to check subsequent cabinets without verifying the current one.",
    "guidance": "After opening a container, the Agent should immediately check its contents to confirm the presence of the target item. This avoids unnecessary steps and ensures efficient task completion by focusing on relevant information at each step."

    "reasoning": "The Agent failed to consider the possibility that the bowl might not be in any of the cabinets and instead continued searching sequentially without checking other potential locations, such as the kitchen counter or table. This inefficient approach led to an unnecessary waste of steps.",
    "guidance": "When searching for an object, the Agent should first check all likely locations (e.g., countertops, tables, drawers) before systematically checking cabinets. This heuristic prioritizes efficiency by reducing the number of steps required to locate an object."

    "reasoning": "The Agent failed to consider the possibility of finding the bowl in the first cabinet it checked (cabinet 3) and instead proceeded to check subsequent cabinets without verifying the contents of the initial ones. This inefficient search strategy led to unnecessary steps and ultimately the failure to locate the bowl.",
    "guidance": "When searching for an object, the Agent should first verify the contents of the first potential location before proceeding to check other locations. This heuristic ensures efficient use of steps by prioritizing immediate checks over sequential exploration, reducing the risk of exceeding the step limit."

    "reasoning": "The Agent failed to consider the possibility of the bowl being in a more accessible location, such as the countertop, instead of continuing to check cabinets. This inefficient search strategy led to unnecessary steps and ultimately the failure to locate the bowl.",
    "guidance": "When searching for an object, prioritize locations that are more likely to contain the object based on common household arrangements (e.g., countertops for bowls). Avoid exhaustive checks of all cabinets unless explicitly instructed, to optimize decision logic and conserve steps."

    "reasoning": "The Agent failed to consider the possibility of the bowl being in other locations, such as the kitchen or dining area, and instead focused only on cabinets. This limited the search space and led to an inefficient search strategy.",
    "guidance": "When searching for an object, the Agent should prioritize locations that are more likely to contain the object based on common household organization, such as countertops, tables, or kitchen areas, rather than focusing solely on cabinets. This heuristic ensures a more efficient search and reduces unnecessary steps."

    "reasoning": "The Agent failed to consider the possibility of checking the correct location for the bowl earlier. Instead of immediately checking cabinet 6, the Agent should have systematically checked all possible locations for the bowl, including the kitchen area or other storage units, which would have led to a faster discovery.",
    "guidance": "When searching for an object, prioritize checking likely locations (e.g., kitchen counters, cabinets, or storage units) in a systematic order, starting from the most probable ones. This reduces unnecessary steps and ensures efficient task completion."
  },

    "window_start": 10,

    "reasoning": "The Agent correctly identified that the cabinet 6 was closed and needed to be opened. However, the Agent failed to check the contents of the cabinet thoroughly before moving on to other locations, which led to unnecessary steps and wasted time.",
    "guidance": "When encountering an object that is closed (e.g., a cabinet), always inspect its contents immediately after opening it to determine if the target item is present. This avoids unnecessary exploration of other locations and optimizes decision-making within step limits."

    "window_start": 11,

    "reasoning": "The Agent failed to recognize that the bowl was already present on countertop 3 in Step 13, but continued searching unnecessarily. This inefficient search wasted steps and delayed the task completion.",
    "guidance": "When searching for an object, the Agent should immediately check all previously visited locations before moving to new ones. This avoids redundant searches and optimizes step usage by prioritizing locations where the object is more likely to be found."

    "reasoning": "The Agent incorrectly attempted to clean the bowl using the sinkbasin, which is not a valid object to clean with. The correct action would have been to clean the bowl with a cloth or another cleaning tool, not the sinkbasin itself.",
    "guidance": "When performing a 'clean a with b' action, ensure that 'b' is a valid cleaning tool (e.g., cloth, sponge) rather than a location or object that cannot be used for cleaning. Prioritize using objects explicitly designated for cleaning tasks to optimize efficiency and avoid invalid actions."

    "step_id": 16,
    "reasoning": "The Agent's reasoning failed to account for the necessity of verifying the availability of the target location (cabinet 1) before attempting to place the bowl there. The Agent assumed the cabinet was suitable without checking if it was accessible or already occupied, leading to an invalid action.",
    "guidance": "Before attempting to place an object in/on a location, verify that the location is accessible and not already occupied. This ensures efficient use of steps and avoids invalid actions due to unavailability of the target location."
